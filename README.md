# Cybersecurity Portfolio - Risk, Governance & Security Operations

This portfolio showcases hands on cybersecurity experience across governance, risk management, access control, incident response, and security operations. The projects are aligned with NIST frameworks and realistic enterprise scenarios, including healthcare focused case studies, to demonstrate practical security decision-making, analytical skills, and the ability to balance technical findings with risk-based recommendations.

The work reflects a broad foundation designed to support multiple cybersecurity paths, including GRC, Security Analyst, SOC, IAM, and future security consulting roles, while emphasizing documentation, risk assessment, and enterprise relevant security scenarios.
